# ScamScanner

ScamScanner is an AI-powered tool that analyzes a website's source code to detect potential scam tactics, phishing attempts, exposed secrets, and other malicious activities. It features a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, all containerized with Docker for easy setup and use.

## Features

  * **Multi-faceted AI Analysis**: Leverages Google's Gemini API for two distinct scans: one for general security threats (phishing, malicious scripts) and another specifically for exposed secrets (API keys, credentials).
  * **Recursive Web Crawler**: Intelligently crawls the target website, downloading relevant HTML and JavaScript content from the same domain while ignoring unnecessary files like images and stylesheets.
  * **Domain Intelligence**: Performs a WHOIS lookup on the target domain to provide crucial context like domain age and registrar information, which are key indicators of a site's legitimacy.
  * **Real-time Progress Updates**: Uses WebSockets to provide a live log of the crawling and analysis process, so you're never left wondering what's happening.
  * **Complete Analysis History**: All scan results are saved to a database and can be viewed on a dedicated history page.
  * **Flexible Input**: Analyze websites via a live URL or by manually pasting or uploading source code.
  * **Downloadable Reports**: Export your detailed analysis results as either a Markdown or a plain text file.

## Tech Stack

  * **Backend**:
      * Python 3.12
      * FastAPI (for the web framework)
      * SQLModel (combined SQLAlchemy and Pydantic)
      * `python-whois` (for domain lookups)
      * Uvicorn & Gunicorn (as the ASGI server)
      * Google GenAI (for AI-driven insights)
  * **Frontend**:
      * React (with TypeScript)
      * Vite (for the build tooling)
      * Tailwind CSS (for styling)
      * React Router (for page navigation)
  * **Database**:
      * SQLite
  * **Containerization**:
      * Docker & Docker Compose

## Getting Started

Run the application locally with Docker.

### Prerequisites

  * **Docker**: Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Environment Setup

You need to provide your Google Gemini API key for the backend to function.

1.  In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local`.

2.  Add your API key to this file:

    ```
    # .env.local
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

### Installation & Running

From the root directory of the project, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend, install all dependencies, and start the services.

Once the containers are running, you can access the application:

  * **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:5173)
  * **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8000)

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **Scanner** page.
2.  Enter a full website URL into the input field and click "Scan Website". If you are unsure or want to scan our test sites, you can enter `demo-scan.com` or `demo-safe.com` and run the scan.
3.  Watch the real-time progress log as the application crawls and analyzes the site.
4.  Once complete, review your detailed report on the results screen.
5.  Visit the **History** page to see a list of all your previous scans.
